## Deploy to Vercel

To deploy to Vercel with server-side rendering:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect the repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and deploy it

The vercel.json file is configured to use the official Vercel Next.js builder, which will handle the deployment properly.

Note: The application is configured for server-side rendering on Vercel, not static export. If you want to use static export, see the GitHub Pages deployment instructions above.
